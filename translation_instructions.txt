Directions for manually setting up translation in Windows. If you're Unix based you probably don't need this.

Derived from:
- https://documentation.help/Sphinx/intl.html
- https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/localization.html
- https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/manage-translations-sphinx.html

Setup:

Make sure you have sphinx and sphinx-intl installed, along with Python and all required packages for this documentation (see requirements.txt). Use the command prompt and pip.

Step 1:

Make sure you have the latest GitHub version of the docs. Use cd to change directory to the docs/source folder. 

Step 2: 

This takes the .rst files in docs/source and turns them into .pot files. 

>sphinx-build -b gettext . _build/gettext

use -v for verbose errors.

Step 3:

This takes the .pot files and turns them into .po files in the _locale directory, and makes one directory per target language.

>sphinx-intl update -p _build/gettext -l fr -l pt_BR -l sp -l en

will do this for three languages plus English (en). The en one is for crowdin. Modify by changing -l (not a 1, but the lowercase letter L) and the language code.

Step 4:

Log in to crowdin with an account that has permissions for the collect-earth-online-doc project.
