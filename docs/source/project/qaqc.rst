Plot Design—Quality Control Options
===================================

We have implemented automated quality assurance and quality control (QAQC) tools for projects created in CEO.

User Assignment
---------------

You can assign members of your institution to a specified proportion of the plots using the user assignment feature.

There are two options, Equal assignments, and Percentage of plots.

- **Equal assignments** splits the total number of plots evenly between users.
- **Percentage of plots** allows for uneven splits. For example, one user can be assigned 50% of the total plots while two other users can each be assigned 25% of the total plots.

Quality Modes
-------------

You can also implement quality control measures using one of three different Quality Modes. This allows multiple users to collect data for the same plot for QA/QC purposes.

- **None**: Quality control is not enabled by default.
- **Overlap**: A certain percentage of each users’ plots are reviewed by the other users.
- **Subject Matter Expert Verification (SME Verification**): A percentage of each users’ plots are reviewed by one or more SMEs. For example, the SME might be someone with deep knowledge of the local landscape, or a project administrator.

.. note::
    When Quality Control is enabled, the project can no longer support User Drawn samples.

When you implement the Quality Control, you will be able to use the QAQC Administrator Review Mode.
