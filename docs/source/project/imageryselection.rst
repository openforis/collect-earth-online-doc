Imagery Selection
=================

In the Imagery Selection pane, you can change the default basemap imagery and the imagery basemaps that are available to users in data collection. Your users can switch between all the available imagery layers during analysis.

Default Imagery
---------------

You can change the Default Imagery, which specifies the imagery that users will see when they begin data collection on your project.

- You may choose any of the imagery options available to your institution, including public and private imagery.
- The default (public) options include any of the public imagery available in CEO, including MapBox Satellite and Mapbox Satellite w/Labels.
- The Imagery Preview pane on the right will display the current selection.
- Some paid imagery, including PlanetMonthly and PlanetDaily do not allow for large area data pulls, so it should not be your default basemap (users will just see a white screen). You will need to set a different default basemap and have your data collectors switch to these imageries once they have zoomed in on a plot to interpret.
- If your project is comparing land use and cover changes between two years, we suggest you select one of your focal years’ imagery as the default imagery. Your users can then easily switch between this year’s imagery and the other year’s imagery in data collection.

.. warning::

    Maxar has deprecated multiple data products previously available in CEO, including: DigitalGlobeRecentIMagery; DigitalGlobeRecentImagery+Streets; DigitalGlobeWMSImagery; and EarthWatch.

Public Imagery
--------------

 - This imagery is available for all institutions. If you have a public project, all users (including those not logged in) can see the imagery. 
 - Click the checkbox next to each imagery source you would like to have available for your project.

Private Institution Imagery
---------------------------

 - This imagery will only be visible to institution members, even if you have your project set to public.
 - Click the checkbox next to each imagery source you would like to have available for your project.
 - You will need to first set up the imagery under the institution imagery management panel. Refer to instructions in :doc:`../institution/imagery`.

Click **[Next]** when you are finished.
