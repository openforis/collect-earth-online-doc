Geo-Dash Implementation
=======================

The **Geo-Dash** is a dashboard that opens in a second window when users begin to analyze sample plots. Geo-Dash provides users with additional information to help them interpret the imagery and better classify sample points and plots. The Geo-Dash tab can be customized to show information such as an NDVI time series, additional imagery, and a forest degradation widget.

You can configure your **Geo-Dash** by clicking on **[Configure Geo-Dash]** from the **Project Information/ Review Project** page.

This will bring up the **Geo-Dash layout screen**, with four options in the upper right corner of the screen.

Clicking on **[Copy Layout]** will allow you to copy the Geo-Dash from another project. 

.. warning::
   This will delete any existing Geo-Dash you have associated with the project!

You can add individual Geo-Dash widgets by clicking **[Add Widget].** To find out what each of the widgets do, click on **[Geo-Dash Help]** to open the **Geo-Dash Help Center**. We will also discuss this functionality below.

CEO uses Google Earth Engine to process many of the Geo-Dash widgets. Therefore, the information about Image Visualization for GEE is also useful here, specifically the min and max descriptions: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/image_visualization.
