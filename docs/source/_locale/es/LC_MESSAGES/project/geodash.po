"The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and two-band EVI (EVI 2) are "
"optimized vegetation indexs. They are designed to have higher sensitivity"
" in high biomass regions e.g. along the equator, correct for canopy "
"background signals, and reduce atmospheric influence on index values. In "
"doing so, these indices addresses some of the key limitations of NDVI, "
"however EVI requires more data to calculate and therefore has its own "
"limitations. EVI 2 is in development and can be calculated just from red "
"and near infrared bands. As with NDVI, red is used to represent dead "
"plants/inanimate objects and green to represent healthy plants. The index"
" varies between 0-1, with 0 representing dead plants and 1 representing "
"very healthy plants. For more information on EVI see e.g. "
