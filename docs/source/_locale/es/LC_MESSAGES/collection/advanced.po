msgid "For the Planet Daily data, you will see a list of checkboxes pop up just to the left of the **Imagery Options**. You can use these checkboxes to refine the dates of the map data you want to see displayed. Planet Daily imagery is received as a stack of images. CEO displays the imagery and the checkboxes in the same order that Planet Daily provides this imagery stack. That is, the top date is also the top layer in the imagery stack. If you turn the top image off by unchecking the box, you will see the next date’s image is now on top. It is like looking through a stack of photographs, removing the top one reveals the photo underneath."
