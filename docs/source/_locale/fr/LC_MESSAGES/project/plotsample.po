"A well-prepared plot and sample design can provide a robust estimate of "
"the parameters of interest for the population (percent forest cover, for "
"example). This is often the most important factor in producing a reliable"
" inventory or accuracy assessment. The goal of a sample is to provide an "
"unbiased estimate of some population measure (e.g. proportion of area), "
"with the smallest variance possible, given constraints including resource"
" availability."

"The first step of the built in CEO sample design is the plot design. The "
"second step is selecting samples within a plot. Using these two steps, "
"many sampling designs are possible with CEO."

"For example, suppose you are quantifying forest cover on a landscape. For"
" this approach, sample points are used to classify land cover and are "
"then summarized at the plot level to create an estimate of the plot’s "
"forest cover percent. Information about plots can then be used to "
"estimate the forest cover at the landscape level and detect patterns or "
"trends. The accuracy of your landscape level estimates will depend on how"
" many plots you classify & how variable the landscape is, among other "
"factors. More detailed theoretical information is available in CEO’s "
"Project Development Manual (found at "
"https://collect.earth/downloads/CEO_Theoretical_Manual.pdf)."

"Also, some terminology might help for the types of sampling available in "
"CEO. **Simple random sampling** means that all points have an equal "
"probability of being selected. It produces unbiased parameters. However "
"geographic balance with small sample sizes can be difficult. Also, rare "
"classes may not receive sufficient coverage. If you have rare classes you"
" want to detect, we highly recommend using a **stratified random "
"sampling** approach. Stratified random sampling is another type of "
"probability sampling where the population is divided into different "
"strata based on shared characteristics. For example, strata might be "
"different land classes or geographic areas."

#: ../../project/plotsample.rst:15 6ebdff41192d4cb2845095161ffd2f43
msgid ""
"Another type of sampling is **systematic gridded sampling**. This is a "
"grid of points placed over the landscape at regular intervals and is not "
"probability sampling. This provides excellent geographic balance, but it "
"is not possible to calculate unbiased estimates of population metric "
"variance."
