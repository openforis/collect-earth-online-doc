"The landscape looks very different from above than it does from the "
"ground! If you have been on a plane, think about how the world looks from"
" that height. If not, imagine yourself slowly rising higher and higher "
"above the ground. Each person soon becomes a spot, you can only see the "
"shape of the roof of each building, trees turn into circular green blobs "
"(or spindly brown, depending on the season). Consider looking at where "
"you live with satellite imagery first. Use your local knowledge to see "
"what roads, buildings, lakes, trees, and more look like."
