"If your project is focused on land use or land cover classification, you "

"classification scheme should be exhaustive, exclusive, consistent with "

"either single level or hierarchical and it does not need to be of uniform"
" detail. Data collectors refer to an interpretation key—a collection of "
"rules, imagery, and guidance—to classify land cover elements. A "
"comprehensive interpretation key allows data collectors to produce more "
"consistent and reliable results."
