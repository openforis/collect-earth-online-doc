Joining an Institution
======================

Several publicly available mapathon projects are featured in the map window on the **Home** screen. Anyone with an internet connection can log into Collect Earth Online and begin collecting data for these projects.

Other projects require users be a member of either an institution or a project. These security levels are pre-determined for each project by the project manager.

Navigating the list of institutions & institution pages
-------------------------------------------------------

A list of all institutions is displayed on the **Home** page. If you are logged in, this list is broken into two: **Your Affiliations** and **Other Institutions**. **Your Affiliations** are institutions to which you belong.

1. Clicking on an institutions' name expands a list of all active **Projects** for the Institution. Clicking on these projects will take you to the project's Data Collection page (see >>Part 4).

2. Next to each institution’s name is a **[VISIT]** button. Clicking on this will open the **Institution** page.

3. On any Institution info page, you can find:

    i.   The institution’s logo, which when clicked will take you to the institution’s website link,

    ii.  The institution’s name,

    iii. A short description of the institution,

    iv.  Imagery feeds available to the institution,

    v.   The institution’s projects, and

    vi.  A list of all registered users associated with the
        institution.

Request to join an institution
------------------------------

1. If your institution already has an account on CEO and you would like to request to be a member, start by navigating to the Institution page via the info button described in A.2-4 above.

2. The list of Users is contained under the **Users tab**. Click on this tab.

3. Click on the yellow **[Request Membership]** button to be considered to join the institution.

4. The institution’s administrator will need to approve your application to the institution.

5. You will receive an email when you are added to the institution or if your role inside the institution changes (e.g. if you are promoted to Admin).

6. Once you are part of an institution, the **Institution** panel on the **Home** page will show your institutions. This makes it easier to access these institutions and their projects.
