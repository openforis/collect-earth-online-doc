Simplified Data Collection
==========================

This section will guide you through the data collection interface and the data collection process for Simplified projects.

Data collection for Simplified projects follows four basic steps:

1. Read the project information, survey questions, and possible answers.
2. Draw and/or select the sample points.
3. Assign the sample points an answer for each question in the survey.
4. Save your answers.

You do not need to be logged in to CEO to collect data for Simplified Projects.

Terms and conditions
--------------------

Before you can start collecting data, you must agree to the terms and conditions of the project. You will be prompted to accept or decline the terms and conditions to voluntarily collect data. You can also add your name if you would like to be recognized for your work. The collected data will be licensed through a CC BY 4.0 license.

The analysis screen
-------------------

First, make sure you click the **[Go to first plot]** button.

Now we will familiarize ourselves with the analysis screen. 

.. tip::
   
   You can access help for the analysis screen at any time by clicking on the purple ? in the top right hand corner of the screen. The help function will point out important features of the data collection page.

Map Window
^^^^^^^^^^

In the center is the map window:

1. Your **Area of Interest** will show up as a yellow rectangle in the map window.
2. Each **Sample Point** is identified with a black outline until it is assigned a label. 

.. tip::
   
   You can change the color of sample points that don't have answers from black to white by selecting the corresponding color radio button next to “Unanswered Color” on the right-hand panel.

3. You can zoom in and out using the blue + and – buttons in the upper left-hand corner of the map window, or by scrolling your mouse wheel.
4. Information about the imagery source is shown at the bottom of the screen.


Options and Survey Questions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On the right-hand side are navigation options, external tool options, and survey questions.

**Navigation options:**

The navigation options are disabled for Simplified projects.

**External Tools options:**

- Click **[Re-Zoom]** to return your focus to the entire Area of Interest.
- **Click [GeoDash]** to open the **GeoDash** pane with additional information about the plot, if it is available for the project (For more detail see :doc:`geodash`).
- You can click **[Download Plot KML]** to download a KML file with the information of any samples you have drawn. Downloading the KML allows you to transfer the plot information to another program, such as Google Earth Desktop. Importantly, the KML functionality allows users to determine the coordinates (latitude and longitude) at which points of interest are located.
- The **[Go to GEE Script]** button may or may not be present on your dashboard. If it is present, it will take you to an Earth Engine Apps website displaying additional data about the plot.

  - This screen will have 6 panels. On the far left, there is a Sentinel 2 composite of the last 12 months. They are colored as infrared color composite (near infrared, mid infrared, red). Reddish brown is forest, agriculture, grass, and shrubs are a lighter shade of orange. Water is purple, and urban areas are shades of blue and green.
  - In the center are Landsat 8 and Landsat 7 Color Yearly mosaics, with a slider so you can choose between years.
  - On the right are NDVI graphs of the plot from MODIS, Landsat 7/8, and Sentinel 2. For the Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel graphs, you can click a point on the graphs to load specific images in the left and center panels.

- Click **[Interpretation Instructions]** to open a pop-up window with instructions on how to collect data for the project. These instructions are provided by the administrators leading the project. This information can be useful if you are unsure how to answer the survey questions.

**Survey Questions**

- This is the area to answer the project’s **Survey Questions**.

.. thumbnail:: ../_images/simplified1.png
  :title: The panel to answer survey questions.
  :width: 60%
  :align: center

- Each project has a different set of numbered survey questions (in the example only “1” question is in the project).
- You can navigate between questions using the forward and back arrows or the numbers.
- The **[Unanswered Color]** radio button changes the color of the survey shapes.
- The **[Save]** button will save your survey answers (it only becomes active when all shapes have been interpreted).
- **[Quit]** will return you to CEO’s **Home** page. If you try to leave the page without saving your answers, you will receive a warning and reminder to save your answers if appropriate.

**User-drawn samples**

- Simplified projects rely on user drawn samples. You will need to draw points, lines, or polygons on the map before you can answer the survey questions.
- There are two icons under **Survey Questions**, a question mark and a pencil.
- When you have the **[question mark]** selected, the Survey Question interface will work as we just discussed.

- However, if you select the **[pencil icon]**, you will see the options that allow you to draw different points, lines, and polygons on the map.

   :align: center

- You can switch between the different shapes by clicking on their respective icons. Note that the project administrator may have restricted the types of geometries (point, line, polygon) that you can create.

**Imagery Selection Pane**

- For Simplified projects, the **Imagery Selection Pane** can be expanded by clicking on the arrow on the left hand side of the screen.

.. thumbnail:: ../_images/simplified2.png
   :title: Imagery selection pane.
   :width: 60%
   :align: center

- You can turn on different imagery layers by clicking the toggle button next to the imagery name.
- You can change the opacity of the imagery by moving the slider.
- You can change the order that imagery displays by clicking and dragging the imagery name.

.. thumbnail:: ../_images/simplified3.png
   :title: Change imagery order.
   :width: 60%
   :align: center

- Different images are helpful for comparing different points in time and/or where one imagery source does not have enough detail to answer the **Survey Questions**. Some imagery options also include the names of towns, villages, etc.

.. note::
   
   Some imagery servers are slow. Please be patient when switching to sources like Planet Daily, since their servers can take about 30 seconds to respond to queries sent by the CEO platform.

To illustrate how to collect data in a simplified project, we will use the example of a project that asks you to identify the location of different types of land cover, specifically looking at agricultural plantations in Indonesia. First, we zoom in to find some plantation boundaries.

On the right panel, under **Survey Questions**, select the edit mode to enable the polygon tool. This means that you can start collecting data. 

.. thumbnail:: ../_images/simplified10.png
  :title: The edit mode.
  :align: center

To create the polygon, click to create vertices. To close the polygon, click on the first vertice again. 

.. thumbnail:: ../_images/simplified11.png
  :title: Drawing a polygon.
  :align: center

It will turn yellow when you have completed the polygon.

.. thumbnail:: ../_images/simplified12.png
  :title: Completed polygon.
  :align: center

Do this as many times as you want (ideally in all areas that you know of plantations).

.. thumbnail:: ../_images/simplified13.png
  :title: Multiple polygons.
  :align: center

Depending on the project settings, you can also place points at the center of the fields. Switch to “Point tool” to collect points.

.. thumbnail:: ../_images/simplified14a.png
  :title: The point tool.
  :align: center

This is a good way to speed up collection time.

 .. thumbnail:: ../_images/simplified14b.png
  :title: Placing points.
  :align: center

When you are done collecting, switch to the question mark under “Survey Questions”.You will need to answer the question for each shape (e.g. polygon, point) created.

.. thumbnail:: ../_images/simplified15.png
  :title: Answering questions.
  :align: center

If all the shapes are the same plantation, hold CTRL and select them all at once.

Click on the answer you wish to select. For this example, we are selecting Palm. You will see the data changing color. You will also note another question appearing. This is because the example project has been set up to ask a follow-up question when you select Palm.
