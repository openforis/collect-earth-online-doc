Start Collecting Data!
======================

There are two types of projects that you could be working on in Collect Earth Online: **Standard** and **Simplified**. The standard project is the most common type of project, while the Simplified project is a more streamlined project type. Standard projects are used for collecting data for e.g. monitoring, reporting, and verification purposes, while Simplified projects are used for collecting data for e.g. training or validating machine learning models. 

The two project types have slightly different interfaces, but the data collection process is similar. The main difference is that Simplified projects have no pre-defined samples and a reduced question set. You will need to draw your own samples before you can answer questions about them.

For both project types, the data collection process consists of the following basic steps:

1. Read the project information, survey questions, and possible answers.
2. Draw and/or select the sample points.
3. Assign the sample points an answer for each question in the survey.
4. Save your answers.

The following sections will guide you through the data collection process for each project type.
