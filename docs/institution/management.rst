Institution management
======================

Institution information
-----------------------

If you are an administrator for an institution, you can make changes to your institution's information after the institution is created.

1. If you want to make changes, start by navigating to your Institution’s info page >>(see A.2-4 above).

2. You can make changes to the institution page by clicking **[Edit]** at the top of the page.

3. You can also delete your institution by clicking [Delete]. This
   action is PERMANENT, and your institution cannot be recovered
   afterwards. ALL PROJECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INSTITUTION WILL ALSO BE
   DELETED.

Key institution components
--------------------------

More importantly, you can also manage three aspects of your institution that allow data collection through CEO. These include the **Imagery** available, the data collection **Projects**, and the **Users** associated with the institution. This information is displayed in three panels on your **Institution’s** info page.

* The **Imagery** tab lists all available imagery and WMS Feeds. You can add new imagery feeds here as well. >>This is discussed in Part 3 of this manual.

* The Projects panel lists your institution's projects, identifies projects as public or private, and allows you to create new projects. >>This is discussed in Part 4: Project Creation of this manual.

* The Users panel lists your institutions' members and allows them to be updated. >>This is discussed below.
   
Institution user (member) management
------------------------------------

1. As an administrator, you can add a Collect Earth Online member to the institution by typing the user's email address into the box and clicking the **[Add User]** button. 

.. tip::
   Only email addresses that have already created a CEO account can be added to the institution.
   
2. If you are successful, a pop-up window will notify you that the user has been given the role "member," and the user's email address will appear in the list of users.

3. You can approve pending affiliation requests as well.

4. To change the role of a user, use the menu to the right of their email address. Available user roles are Administrator and Member. Users who are Administrators can edit any of the institution's projects, add and delete imagery, and manage the Institution's Users.

5. To restrict the Administrator capabilities of a user to only one of the institution's projects, you can create a new institution specifically for that project. Add the user as an Administrator for the new Institution.

6. You can also remove users from the institution using this drop-down menu and selecting the Remove option.

Other administrator privileges
------------------------------

1. As an administrator you can review and modify the answers for all plots, including plots labeled by other CEO users. Members of an institution can only review and modify answers for plots they themselves have labeled. To access this feature, use **Review** toggle for the **Navigate Through** dropdown menu on the Collection Page. See Part 6: Administrator review mode for more information.

2. As an administrator you can review Draft Mode projects that you or other administrators have created. >>This is discussed further in Part 4: Project Creation.

3. As an administrator, you can download collected data from Institution projects. >>See Part 5: Project Information Interface Sec. E: Export Data for a list of the data fields included in data download.
