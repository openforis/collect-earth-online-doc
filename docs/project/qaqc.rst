A. **Plot Design—Quality Control Options**

We have implemented automated quality assurance and quality control
(QAQC) tools for projects created in CEO.

1. You can assign members of your institution to plots using the user
   assignment feature.

2. There are two options, Equal assignments, and Percentage of plots.

i.  **Equal assignments** splits the total number of plots evenly
    between users.

ii. **Percentage of plots** allows for uneven splits. For example, one
    user can be assigned 50% of plots while two other users can be
    assigned 25% of plots respectively.

3. You can also implement quality control measures using one of three
   different Quality Modes. This allows multiple users to collect data
   for the same plot for QA/QC purposes.

i.   **None**: Quality control is not enabled by default.

ii.  **Overlap**: A certain percentage of each users’ plots are reviewed
     by the other users.

iii. **Subject Matter Expert Verification (SME Verification**): A
     percentage of each users’ plots are reviewed by one or more SMEs.
     For example, the SME might be someone with deep knowledge of the
     local landscape, or a project administrator.

4. Note that when Quality Control is enabled, the project can no longer
   support User Drawn samples.

5. When you implement the Quality Control, you will be able to use the
   QAQC Administrator Review Mode. See Part 6: Administrator Review Mode
   for further information.
