5. Administrator Review Mode

Using the Data Collection interface, Administrators can review their
projects.

1. | For projects with QA/QC enabled, administrators can use the Review
     Mode to Navigate through plots with Disagreement. This navigation
     feature allows administrators to choose the level of disagreement
     between questions on the fly, then allow them to navigate between
     plots that have this level of disagreement or more.
   | Disagreement is provided as a percentage and represents how far
     apart users’ responses for the plot are from one another. If you
     have multiple samples per plot, the disagreement per sample is
     calculated and then averaged.
   | We suggest that you start with a disagreement percentage of around
     50% and adjust to your needs.

2. | Once data for the project has been collected using a quality
     control approach, Administrators can press the “View Disagreements”
     button to bring up a new window that compares every user’s answers
     for the plot’s questions.
   | This navigation mode is particularly useful for situations where
     administrators are identifying difficult plots to identify,
     difficult classes to identify, or are holding a group meeting to
     work through the identification of plots with high disagreement.

3. In addition, administrators can Navigate through unanalyzed plots,
   all analyzed plots, flagged plots, low confidence plots, and
   individual different users’ plots.
