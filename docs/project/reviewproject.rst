Reviewing Projects
==================

In the Project Wizard
---------------------

Once the project set up is complete, click on **[Review]** in the bottom right-hand corner.

You will now see an overview of your project details.

Scroll through to check that everything is correct. If everything is correct, click **[Create Project]**. You will need to accept CEO’s terms and conditions.

If you notice a mistake, click **[Continue Editing]** to fix it.

After you click **[Create Project]**, a pop-up window will ask ‘Do you REALLY want to create this project?’ Click **[OK]**.

After you Create the project, you will be taken to the Project Information panel. 

Project Information Interface
-----------------------------

If you are navigating back to the **Project Information** (not visiting right after project creation), you can reach this page by finding your Institution on the **Home** page left panel. Click the **[Edit]** icon (|image15|) next to the project name to get to the **Project Information/Review Project** page.

The Project Information Interface has two components: **Project Details** on the left and **Project Management** on the right.
