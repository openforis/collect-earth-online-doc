Familiarize yourself with satellite imagery & photo identification

   1. The landscape looks very different from above than it does from
      the ground! If you have been on a plane, think about how the world
      looks from that height. If not, imagine yourself slowly rising
      higher and higher above the ground. Each person soon becomes a
      spot, you can only see the shape of the roof of each building,
      trees turn into circular green blobs (or spindly brown, depending
      on the season). Consider looking at where you live with satellite
      imagery first. Use your local knowledge to see what roads,
      buildings, lakes, trees, and more look like.

   2. Here are some sample images illustrating different land uses. All
      images are courtesy of Bing Maps.

      i.   Forest

           a. Conifer forest

           b. Deciduous Forest (Temperate)

      ii.  Pasture

           a. Canada

      iii. Agriculture

           a. Western US (arid)

           b. Midwestern US (temperate)

      iv.  Water-Lake

           a. Myanmar

      v.   Water-River

           a. Guatemala

   3. Remember that depending on the study region, seasons may change
      how the landscape looks.

   4. Here are some additional resources to help you learn how to
      visually interpret forests, grasslands, buildings, and more.
