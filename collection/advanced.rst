Advanced plot analysis
======================

1. For analyses comparing two time periods, toggle between imagery
    from two different dates.

    i.    You may need to click **[Update Imagery]** when toggling
        between different imagery sources.

    ii.   Your institution should have set up the project with two
        labeled imagery options for the time periods of interest.

    iii.  Click the **drop-down menu** under **IMAGERY OPTIONS** and
        select the earlier of the two time periods.

    iv.   Then, repeat this for the later of the two time periods.

    v.    Some imagery options allow you to enter imagery start and
        end dates.

    vi.   Some imagery options also allow you to choose a feature
        profile for the imagery. This is essentially a filter that
        the imagery provider puts on their data. For example, the
        Cloud Cover Profile filters out imagery with too much cloud
        cover.

    vii.  For the Planet Daily data, you will see a list of checkboxes
        pop up just to the left of the **Imagery Options**. You can
        use these checkboxes to refine the dates of the map data you
        want to see displayed. Planet Daily imagery is received as a
        stack of images. CEO displays the imagery and the checkboxes
        in the same order that Planet Daily provides this imagery
        stack. That is, the top date is also the top layer in the
        imagery stack. If you turn the top image off by unchecking
        the box, you will see the next date’s image is now on top.
        It is like looking through a stack of photographs, removing
        the top one reveals the photo underneath.

    viii. If your project uses SecureWatch Imagery, you will be able
        to select a range of dates (under **Select Range**) or
        specific dates (under **Select Dates**). Your institution
        will have set a default range of dates when the project was
        created. The list of **Available Dates** will automatically
        populate with the available dates for the sample plot you
        are looking at. When you answer a question, the date or
        range of dates will be recorded. Please refer to any
        specific instructions your institution has given you
        regarding which imagery options to use for SecureWatch.

    ix.   Make sure you also refer to the second tab, where the
        Geo-Dash information is presented. The time series
        information that is presented in the Geo-Dash window is also
        helpful in determining if change has occurred on the
        landscape.

    x.    If both images look the same, no change occurred, so we
        select all points and label them as no change or stable.

    xi.   If there has been change, select the appropriate change
        option.

    xii.  Repeat for all Sample Value categories.

2. Seasonality issues can occur when different land uses appear
    different between seasons. For example, a grassland might be
    bright green in spring but look brown in the summer. If you saw
    just the brown imagery, you might think the brown is dirt and
    incorrectly classify the grassland as barren dirt.

    i.   To avoid this issue, try switching between different imagery
        that is available to you. Look to see if there is imagery
        available from different seasons to help with your decision.

    ii.  You can also look at the Geo-Dash page for the plot to see if
        there is any NDVI or other additional information that could
        help you.

    iii. You can also click on **Download Plot KML** to download a
        .kml file to view in Google Earth. Google Earth has multiple
        current and historic imagery sources that can help you
        identify a plot.

3. Zooming in and out to gather contextual clues from the landscape
    is important for multiple land use and land cover types. For
    example:

    i.  Water in larger waterbodies often appears black or dark until
        you zoom out.

    ii. Tree plantations may look like forests until you zoom out and
        see the regular pattern of planted trees.

4. You can click **[Flag Plot]** if the imagery is insufficient
    (missing, low resolution, etc.) to accurately label the plot
    attributes. It will automatically reload the next plot for your
    project.

    i.   **Flag Plot** will delete any attributes that have been
        assigned to the points/plots.

    ii.  Using **Navigate Through** set to **My Analyzed Plots** you
        can return to the flagged plot and try to answer the
        questions again. The **flag plot** button will be disabled
        because the plot has already been flagged and you cannot flag
        it again.

    iii. Your responses will be recorded, and the plot will be
        unflagged if you click **Save**.

    iv.  Plots can either be flagged or saved by a user, but not both.

5. Sometimes plots are hard to interpret, even with good imagery!
    These plots can only be reliably and accurately classified by
    having knowledge of local agricultural systems, local vegetation
    types, and landscape patterns.

    i.   Try making use of the surroundings of the plot to glean as
        much information as you can before making a best guess.

    ii.  If different users identify the plot differently, it will be
        flagged internally as a difficult plot.

    iii. If you do not feel comfortable interpreting the plot, you
        should click **[Flag Plot]**.

6. At any time, you can skip a plot for later analysis by clicking
    the **[Next Plot Arrow]** in the **Plot Navigation** tab.
    Alternatively, click on **[Previous Plot Arrow]** to revisit the
    previous plot

7. If you click on the project name, it will show the number and
    percent of plots completed, the number and percent of plots
    flagged as bad, and the total number of plots. An accuracy score
    based on the project’s training data will also be available soon.
