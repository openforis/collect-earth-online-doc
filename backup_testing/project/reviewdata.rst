Administrator Review Mode
=========================

Using the Data Collection interface, Institution Administrators can review their projects.

For projects with QA/QC enabled, administrators can use the Review Mode to Navigate through plots with Disagreement. This navigation feature allows administrators to choose the level of disagreement between questions on the fly, then allow them to navigate between plots that have the specified level of disagreement or more.

Disagreement is provided as a percentage and represents how far apart users’ responses for the plot are from one another. If you have multiple samples per plot, the disagreement per sample is calculated and then averaged.

.. tip::
  
    We suggest that you start with a disagreement percentage of around 50% and adjust to your needs.

Once data for the project has been collected using a quality control approach, Administrators can press the **[View Disagreements]** button to bring up a new window that compares every user’s answers for the plot’s questions.

.. tip::
  
    This navigation mode is particularly useful for situations where administrators are identifying difficult plots to identify, difficult classes to identify, or are holding a group meeting to work through the identification of plots with high disagreement.
  
In addition, administrators can Navigate through unanalyzed plots, all analyzed plots, flagged plots, low confidence plots, and individual users’ plots.

This functionality can be used in conjunction with the **QAQC Dashboard** to identify problematic plots and users. The QAQC Dashboard provides a summary of the project, including statistics about the project, plots, and users. It also allows administrators to upload external data files for validation. More information about the QAQC Dashboard can be found in the :doc:`/project/qaqcdashboard` documentation.
