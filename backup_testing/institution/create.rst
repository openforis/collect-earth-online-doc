List of Institutions & Institution pages
----------------------------------------

A list of all Institutions is displayed on the Home page. If you are logged in, this list is broken into two: **Your Affiliations** and **Other Institutions**. **Your Affiliations** are Institutions to which you belong. Next to each Institution's name is a **[VISIT]** button. Clicking on this will open the Institution page.
